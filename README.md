Welcome to WakeUp project !

To get started, follow these steps :

- pip install pipenv (install globally pipenv)

- git clone git@github.com:Paul-de-Barbeyrac/wakeup.git

- cd into your directory

- In the terminal type : export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=True

- pipenv install

- pipenv shell (to activate virtual env)

You are good to go, just run : python main.py

If you need to install other libraries, just run pipenv install library_name instead of pip install library_name.

All dependencies requirements are listed in the Pipfile and they will be installed inside a .venv folder in your project directory.

Let's go !
